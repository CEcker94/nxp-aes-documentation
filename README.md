# NXP-AES-Documentation (nxp-aes-documentation)
The documentation for a Project of three Master Engineering-Students at the university of applied sciences in Landshut Germany (Ambrosch Markus, Summer Matthias and Ecker Christian).

This repository contains all the datasheets, pictures, circuit diagrams and most importantly the report of this project.

### 1.1 Information
The goal of the project is the construction and programming of a model vehicle for the Next Experience (NXP) Cup with a specially built, self-driving vehicle. In this competition the 1:18 scale vehicles must drive safely and independently through a course in the shortest possible time. The roadway is bordered by two black stripes applied to a white background. The vehicle must recognize these limitations and, based on their evaluation, adjust the speed of the vehicle and its steering angle.
